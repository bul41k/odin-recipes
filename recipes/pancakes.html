    <h2>How to Make Pancakes </h2>
    <p>As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a tried-and-true favorite yet? You're in luck! The Allrecipes community can't get enough of these classic buttermilk pancakes. Reviewers say they're light, fluffy, moist, and full of rich flavor. </p>
    <h3>Pancakes Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
        <li>Leaveners: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
        <Li>Salt: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</Li>
        <li>Buttermilk: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
        <li>Milk: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
        <li>Butter: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make Pancakes Step-By-Step </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
        <li> Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown. </li>
